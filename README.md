# angle-openomsi

Builds of Google's [ANGLE](https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle) for openOMSI's
"ANGLE (DirectX 11)" graphics option on Windows: OpenGL ES 3.0 over Direct3D 11, for older
graphics cards whose DirectX 12, Vulkan and OpenGL drivers do not run openOMSI. openOMSI's
fork of wgpu ([wgpu-openomsi](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/wgpu-openomsi), the `angle`
feature) loads `libEGL.dll` and `libGLESv2.dll` from the game's folder.

* `ANGLE_REVISION`: the ANGLE branch and commit that is built.
* `args.gn`: the build arguments (Direct3D 11 only, x64, release).
* `.github/workflows/build.yml`: builds them on GitHub Actions when either changes (or by
  hand) and publishes a release `angle-<branch>-<commit>` with the DLLs, ANGLE's licence,
  the revision, the arguments, `SHA256SUMS`, and a build provenance attestation
  (`gh attestation verify <file> --repo openOMSI-Project/angle-openomsi`).

Nothing here is modified ANGLE: the DLLs are built from the upstream source as it is. ANGLE
is BSD-licensed; its licence travels with every release as `LICENSE-ANGLE.txt`.

To move to a newer ANGLE: put another `chromium/<branch> <commit>` in `ANGLE_REVISION`,
push, and point openOMSI's Windows packaging at the new release tag and checksum.
